GAMES:

1) Tennis game: Old-school game, one of the first games i ever played as a kid. You are controlling left paddle with a mouse movement and the goal is to beat the computer, or more accuratelly not to let the ball pass your paddle. The game is played to 3 and in order to win you have to score 3 points against the computer. 


2) Flappy Bird: My own low-graphic remake of once popular mobile phone game, "Flappy Bird". When the game starts, you are controling the green ball. Mouse click on black-colored area allows the ball to jump. The goal of the game is to go through as many holes in the walls as possible, without touching them, and without making contact to the edges of the canvas(black area).
When one of previous 2 conditions isn't met, the game stops, player is presented with his points, and the game can be restarted.
